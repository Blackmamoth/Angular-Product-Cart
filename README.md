# A simple product cart/shopping cart application

## This app uses angular for frontend and json-server as a fake rest api.

## A user can do the following in this application/website

1. View products
2. Add/Remove products to/from cart
3. Add a product to the list (to make this a CRUD project).
4. A user can checkout a product already in the cart, which will simply remove it from the cart rather removing it from the json file.

## To get the website running once you've cloned it

1. Type this command in the root of the repo to install the dependencies to run the angular app and also the json-server.

## `$ npm install`

2. Open two terminals and navigate to the root of the repo and in one of them type this command to start the angular app
	
## `$ npm start`

3. In the second terminal type this command 

## `$ npm run server`

4. After both the servers are running simply navigate to **http://localhost:4200** on your browser.
